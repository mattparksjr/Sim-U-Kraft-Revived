Sim-U-Kraft Revived
-------------------------------------------
This project is an attempt to revive the once popular Sim-U-Kraft Mod. It was originally made
for mining 1.6.4 by Scott Hather, and then later revived and updated to 1.12.2 by the Resimulators.
However, both of these versions of the mod are no longer maintained or updated. The plan is to bring
Sim-U-Kraft to a modern mincraft version, and to keep it that way. Part of the reason the mod was
never updated in the first place, was the massive API changes that forge went through over the years.
